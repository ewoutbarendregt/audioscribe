## [2026-06-14] — Transcription activity log + latest Gemini models everywhere

**Session**: claude/feat/transcription-activity-log (+ claude/chore/latest-gemini-models)
**Changed**: static/index.html, transcriber.py, main.py, FEATURES.md
**Summary**: (1) Added a small scrollable (~3-line) "Activity" log to the Review loading
state. The `/api/transcribe` SSE stream already emitted `progress` and `debug` events; the
frontend now captures both into `S.log`, renders them in a fixed-height monospace box
(id `asLog`) that auto-scrolls to the newest line, and resets it per run. Surfaces exactly
what the system is doing during upload transcription (connect, duration check, chunking,
upload, model call, segment count). (2) Moved every Gemini call to the latest model line —
verified available models against the live API: `transcriber.py` transcription
`gemini-2.5-flash` → `gemini-3.5-flash` (new `TRANSCRIBE_MODEL`); live conversation
`gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-latest` → `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` (latest 3.x Live
model; there is no 3.x native-audio model — confirmed the new model accepts our
LiveConnectConfig). Summarize/amend were already on `gemini-3.5-flash`. No `2.5` refs left.

**Prompts used**:
- "why did it call gemini 2.5 flash, we need to be calling the latest gemini api's everywhere"
- "during the transcription of an uploaded audiofile, i need to be able to see what the
  system is doing, show a small section of 3 lines with the log (scrollable)"

## [2026-06-14] — Restore diarized transcript view + fix stale service worker

**Session**: claude/fix/restore-diarized-transcript
**Changed**: static/index.html, static/sw.js
**Summary**: Fixed two regressions from the redesign. (1) The upload flow routed straight
into the summary-only Review screen, hiding the original app's primary output — the full
**diarized, timestamped transcript**. Added a "Full transcript" panel to the Review
screen (speaker chips + timestamps, turn/speaker counts, expanded by default for uploads,
collapsed for live) with always-available Export transcript / Export summary buttons (no
longer gated on the "everyone's aligned" state). The SSE result now preserves each
segment's `timestamp` string. Empty results now show a clear "No speech could be
detected" message. (2) `sw.js` was cache-first on the HTML document with background
revalidate, so every deploy was invisible to returning users until a second reload —
switched the document/navigation requests to **network-first** (cache fallback offline)
and bumped `CACHE_NAME` to `audioscribe-v3`. This stale-cache behaviour was a major
contributor to "the new version doesn't work" after a deploy.

Diagnosis note: staging logs confirmed the backend transcribe pipeline (upload → Gemini
`gemini-2.5-flash` → diarization, chunking check) works end-to-end; the one failing test
returned 0 segments because Gemini judged that audio file distorted/silent — not a code
fault. The real issue was the UI hiding the transcript + the SW serving stale HTML.

**Prompts used**:
- "the original transcribe function (with diarization and chunking of larger files while
  maintaining the attribution of sentences to the same people in the conversation) does
  not seem to work now"

## [2026-06-14] — Live Conversation UI redesign (Audioscribe design card)

**Session**: claude/feat/audioscribe-design-redesign
**Changed**: main.py, requirements.txt, static/index.html, ../.claude/launch.json (new), PLAN.md/BUILD.md/FEATURES.md/TEST.md/BUGS.md (new scaffold)
**Summary**: Implemented the "warm dark, voice-first" Audioscribe design (fetched from
the Claude Design handoff bundle at design link `PRb-w-Im86T1ASM03E4SNg`). Full
frontend rewrite of `static/index.html` as a faithful vanilla-JS recreation of the
three-screen flow — Home (record orb + drag/drop upload), Live (reactive record orb,
animated waveform/pulse rings, live caption with speaker chip, real-time transcript,
participant rail), and Review (read-aloud summary with word-by-word karaoke
highlighting, agree / object-and-revise per item, floating transport bar, and a
"Listening to the room" sheet for spoken objections). Dark warm palette (#100F0D /
#E9A23B amber / #F4EFE6 cream), Hanken Grotesque + Newsreader serif + JetBrains Mono
via Google Fonts.

Backend (main.py, v1.5.0):
- Restored & re-developed the live-conversation endpoints that the 2026-06-13 rollback
  removed: `WS /api/live-record` (streams 16kHz Int16 PCM to the Gemini Live API
  `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-latest`, relays `user_transcript` / `model_text` /
  `audio_chunk` events; model is a silent observer), `POST /api/summarize-live`, and
  `POST /api/amend-summary`.
- Summarization now follows the new design: `summarize-live` returns **structured
  blocks** (`summary` points + `action` items with owner/due) via a Gemini structured-
  output schema on `gemini-3.5-flash`; `amend-summary` rewrites a single block from a
  participant's objection. Both share the model constant `TEXT_MODEL`.
- Original upload+transcription (`POST /api/transcribe`, SSE) is unchanged; the frontend
  now feeds its result segments into `summarize-live` so uploads land on the same Review
  screen.
- CSP updated to allow Google Fonts (`fonts.googleapis.com` style-src,
  `fonts.gstatic.com` font-src) + `ws:`/`wss:` connect-src + `blob:` worker/script for
  the PCM AudioWorklet. `google-genai` pin bumped 1.0.0 → 1.47.0 (Live API support).

Frontend live audio: in-browser AudioWorklet downsamples mic to 16kHz Int16 PCM and
streams it over the WebSocket; the assistant's 24kHz PCM replies are decoded and played
via Web Audio. Object → mic-captures the objection into the textarea (operator can also
type) → `amend-summary` → revised block + read-aloud resumes. Auth token (Bearer for
HTTP, `?token=` for WS), relative URLs (subpath-safe for `/projects/audioscribe`), and
service-worker registration preserved.

Verified locally (dummy key): all routes register, server healthy on v1.5.0, CSP header
correct, `summarize-live` empty-segments path returns `{blocks:[]}`. Frontend verified
in the preview — Home, Live, Review and the Listening sheet all render pixel-faithfully
to the design with zero console errors; karaoke highlight advances correctly. NOT yet
verified end-to-end against a real GEMINI_API_KEY (live mic→Gemini and upload→summarize
need a real key on the VPS).

**Prompts used**:
- "implement this design, use the latest gemini models (e.g. gemini 3.5 flash), maintain
  the original upload and transcription functionality (the summarization function should
  be according to the new design) and include/redevelop the live conversation logic.
  Here is the design: … PRb-w-Im86T1ASM03E4SNg … Implement: Audioscribe.dc.html"

## [2026-06-09] — Security hardening + Trustable VPS deployment

**Session**: claude/security-hardening-and-vps-deploy
**Changed**: main.py, requirements.txt, Dockerfile, static/index.html, .gitignore, README.md, deploy.sh (new), api-key-flow.drawio (new)
**Summary**: Hardened the API after a security review and moved deployment off
Google Cloud Run onto the Trustable.nl staging + prod VPSes (Docker + Caddy).
The Gemini key now lives only in `/opt/trustable/audioscribe.env` on each host
(no Secret Manager dependency).

Security changes (main.py):
- Bearer-token auth on `POST /api/transcribe` via the `API_TOKEN` env var
  (unset = open, for local dev only).
- Per-IP rate limiting with `slowapi` (`RATE_LIMIT`/hour, default 10).
- Generic client-facing error messages; full exceptions logged server-side only.
- Bounded `speakers` form field (`ge=1, le=20`).
- Removed the client-controlled `debug` flag.
- `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options,
  Referrer-Policy). NB: `BaseHTTPMiddleware` imports from `starlette.middleware.base`,
  not `fastapi.middleware.base`.

Frontend (static/index.html): one-time API-token prompt stored in localStorage,
sent as `Authorization: Bearer`; 401/429 handling; "Set API token" footer link.

Deployment:
- App is a profile-gated `audioscribe` service inside the trustable
  docker-compose stack on each VPS (profile keeps it invisible to trustable's
  own CI deploys). Caddy strips the `/projects/audioscribe` prefix
  (`flush_interval -1` for SSE).
- `deploy.sh` builds `linux/amd64` (VPSes are x86_64, dev machine is arm64),
  pushes to `ghcr.io/ewoutbarendregt/audioscribe`, then SSHes to the
  `trustable-staging` / `trustable-prod` aliases and runs
  `docker compose --profile audioscribe up -d`.
- Dockerfile: added `curl` (used by the container healthcheck), explicit COPY.
- Subpath fix: frontend now uses relative URLs (`api/transcribe`, `manifest.json`,
  `sw.js`) instead of absolute (`/api/...`), which bypassed the `/projects/audioscribe`
  prefix and hit the trustable web app (returned HTML → "Unexpected token '<'").
  Also fixed manifest `start_url` and the service worker (relative cache paths,
  `/api/` detection, cache bumped to v2).

Deployed and verified live on 2026-06-09: both hosts healthy, public `/health`
200, auth gate returns 401 without/with-wrong token.

**Prompts used**:
- "run a security check on this code, particularly around the google API and the API keys"
- "fix #1,2,3" then "fix # 4-7" (the numbered findings from the review)
- "how can we securely handle the Gemini API key in this project?"
- "we will deploy the application on the trustable staging vps ... under /projects/audioscribe and we will not use cloud run"
- "the trustable code is deployed to both staging and prod ... audioscribe also needs to be deployed to both"
- "I am no longer using secret manager" → removed all Secret Manager references
